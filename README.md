I'm trying to figure out more information about non-transitive dice.

There's several combinations that could work and the one in the paper cited is the best. You can see that with `one-way-set-of-three.js`. There's a lot of output but only the last line matters. It will list the rolls and the percentage it wins over the set to the right. Also the average odds and the minimum odds remain.

|    Sides    | Odds To Win Vs Next |
| :---------: | :-----------------: |
| 1 4 4 4 4 4 |        69.44        |
| 3 3 3 3 3 6 |        58.33        |
| 2 2 2 5 5 5 |        58.33        |

Average odds: 62.04%
Minimum odds: 58.33%
